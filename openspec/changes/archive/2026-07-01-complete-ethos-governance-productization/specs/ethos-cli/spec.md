- **THEN** the CLI reports `ok=true` and `state=ready` for successful readiness
- **AND** the CLI reports `executed=false`

#### Scenario: Executed proof is proven
- **WHEN** `ethos prove --execute --json` completes with all gates passing
- **THEN** the CLI reports `ok=true` and `state=proven`
- **AND** the CLI reports `executed=true`

### Requirement: Self OpenSpec Lifecycle Mode
ETHOS CLI SHALL expose OpenSpec lifecycle review through the public ETHOS
command plane.
