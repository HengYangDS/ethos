## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit mutation context contract
ETHOS SHALL define mutation-capable operations with explicit target-root,
checkout-role, editor-root, target-path, and admission-result fields.

#### Scenario: Mutation context is auditable
- **WHEN** a mutation-capable operation is admitted or blocked
- **THEN** the machine result includes target root, editor root, branch role,
  target paths, decision, and required gaps

### Requirement: Documentation carrier contract
ETHOS SHALL distinguish human-facing Markdown, durable TOML config, public JSON
command output, ecosystem-native YAML, generated JSONL, ignored local indexes,
and tracked evidence by author, lifecycle, and truth status.

#### Scenario: Machine and human carriers do not collapse
- **WHEN** ETHOS defines a repository governance record
- **THEN** durable hand-authored configuration uses TOML unless an ecosystem
  standard requires another carrier
- **AND** public command and MCP payloads use JSON
- **AND** human judgment, design, reviews, and retrospectives use Markdown

### Requirement: Projection digest contract
ETHOS SHALL require generated tracked agent or host projections to carry source
identity sufficient for drift detection.

#### Scenario: Projection drift is checkable
- **WHEN** ETHOS generates a tracked agent or host projection
- **THEN** the projection records its source surface or digest
- **AND** a later drift check can determine whether the projection is stale
