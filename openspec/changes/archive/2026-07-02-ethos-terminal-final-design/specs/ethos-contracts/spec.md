## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Capability Profile Facet Contract

ETHOS SHALL define capability profiles with decision axes and recommended facets
so OpenSpec proposal routing can be validated without hardcoded domain terms.

#### Scenario: Capability profile declares routing facets

- **WHEN** ETHOS validates a product capability profile
- **THEN** the profile includes decision axes used for routing and review
- **AND** recommended facets describe local valid values for proposal metadata
- **AND** aliases remain optional diagnostic metadata rather than routing truth.
