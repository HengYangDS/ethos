## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Workflow Runtime Contract
ETHOS SHALL define workflow runtime contracts as provider-neutral schemas and
TOML declarations over derived repository facts.

#### Scenario: Workflow contract is inspected
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates `system/workflows.toml`
- **THEN** the contract exposes lifecycle states, transitions, guard names, required facts, node kinds, enforcement modes, event streams, run-state locality, handoff locality, and eval metrics
- **AND** every transition references declared states and guards
- **AND** every blocking invalid-state reference maps to the ETHOS invalid-state taxonomy
- **AND** no workflow contract requires `.comet`, `.taskmaster`, `.specify`, or another external runtime store as authority

### Requirement: Handoff Package Contract
ETHOS SHALL define digest-bound handoff packages as context projections over
repository truth.

#### Scenario: Handoff package is validated
- **WHEN** a handoff package is inspected
- **THEN** it records source refs, source digests, target actor, intended use, freshness state, and proof/evidence refs
- **AND** stale source digests block trust-bearing handoff claims
- **AND** handoff content remains context until promoted into evidence or chronicle
