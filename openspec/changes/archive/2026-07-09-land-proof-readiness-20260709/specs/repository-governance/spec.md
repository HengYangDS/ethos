## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Land readiness is proof-grounded

ETHOS SHALL NOT report a Work Lane as ready to land unless the current HEAD has
valid executed proof evidence.

#### Scenario: Work Lane land dry-run without executed proof is blocked

- **GIVEN** a clean Work Lane with no structural landing gaps
- **AND** no valid executed proof record exists for the Work Lane HEAD
- **WHEN** `ethos land --json` evaluates the Work Lane
- **THEN** ETHOS reports `proof_not_proven`
- **AND** ETHOS does not report `ready_to_land`
- **AND** the payload exposes `proof_readiness.head` bound to the current HEAD
- **AND** the next action is `ethos prove --execute --expect-head <HEAD> --json`

#### Scenario: Work Lane land dry-run with executed proof is ready

- **GIVEN** a clean Work Lane with no structural landing gaps
- **AND** a valid executed proof record exists for the Work Lane HEAD
- **WHEN** `ethos land --json` evaluates the Work Lane
- **THEN** ETHOS reports `ready_to_land`
- **AND** `proof_readiness.state` is `proven`
