## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Declarative Registry Compilation

ETHOS SHALL compile durable coupling and standards registry facts from strict
frozen TOML contracts before emitting public projections.

#### Scenario: A valid declaration projects stable registry data

- **WHEN** a registry declaration is loaded
- **THEN** its contract validates before projection
- **AND** declared static fields preserve order and payload shape
- **AND** runtime facts are added only at adapter boundaries

#### Scenario: An invalid declaration is rejected before projection

- **WHEN** a declaration contains unknown fields, duplicate ids, or malformed admission data
- **THEN** no partial public registry is emitted
- **AND** declaration-level tests cover the rejection
