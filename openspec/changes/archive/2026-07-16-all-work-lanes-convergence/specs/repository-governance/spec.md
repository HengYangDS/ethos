## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Cohort-bound full Work Lane convergence

ETHOS SHALL treat a request to converge multiple Work Lanes as an exact,
observation-bound local program and SHALL NOT interpret a branch prefix or
session instruction as reusable wildcard authority.

#### Scenario: a convergence cohort is frozen before mutation

- **GIVEN** a maintainer requests convergence of multiple existing Work Lanes
- **WHEN** the program begins
- **THEN** a separate owned governance Work Lane records the exact branch, HEAD,
  worktree binding, dirty state, lease/incarnation evidence, claim binding,
  intended disposition, and target-observation evidence for each lane
- **AND** later-created refs are outside the cohort unless separately admitted
- **AND** every effect recomputes mutable target facts before mutation.

#### Scenario: graph absorption does not erase a dirty overlay

- **GIVEN** a lane HEAD is equal to or an ancestor of accepted truth
- **AND** its linked worktree contains a dirty tracked or untracked delta
- **WHEN** convergence classifies the lane
- **THEN** the delta is preserved and semantically reviewed before retirement
- **AND** graph ancestry alone cannot authorize deletion.

#### Scenario: a valid foreign lease remains holder-bound

- **GIVEN** a cohort lane has a normalized valid lease owned by another holder
- **WHEN** convergence needs its implementation or closeout
- **THEN** normal holder completion or a quiesced exact handoff is preferred
- **AND** process absence, provider identity, or a supplied holder string does
  not grant takeover authority
- **AND** replay in an owned successor keeps the original lane observe-only.

#### Scenario: exceptional cohort resolution consumes accepted judgment

- **GIVEN** a cohort lane is dirty, missing trusted lease state, owner-uncertain,
  or requires irreversible retirement
- **WHEN** the lane is resolved
- **THEN** an accepted Chronicle has already bound the exact policy and target
- **AND** a fresh two-phase decision binds one exact observation and recovery
  plan
- **AND** dirty content is preserved before retirement
- **AND** a stale observation blocks the effect instead of falling back to raw
  Git deletion.

#### Scenario: local convergence completion keeps evidence planes separate

- **WHEN** all cohort intent has been integrated or explicitly superseded
- **THEN** strict carrier completion, parity, HEAD-bound executed proof,
  candidate landing, accepted-root closeout, and lane retirement are verified as
  distinct transitions
- **AND** recovery-package retention remains independent
- **AND** local completion does not claim remote push, hosted execution, or
  distribution publication.
