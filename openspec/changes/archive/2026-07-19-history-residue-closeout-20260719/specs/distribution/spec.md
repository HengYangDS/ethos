## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Release configuration advertises only active policy

ETHOS release configuration and adopter scaffolds SHALL expose only fields that
are consumed by active release policy and SHALL derive artifact homes from the
canonical generated-artifact topology.

#### Scenario: Release configuration is loaded

- **WHEN** product or adopter release policy reads `.ethos/release.toml`
- **THEN** protected refs, host surfaces, publication remotes, and attestation
  policy remain available
- **AND** dead `version_source`, `tag_pattern`, and `artifact_glob = "dist/*"`
  fields are not generated or treated as configurable behavior.

#### Scenario: Distribution output is located

- **WHEN** a build or release operation resolves Python artifacts
- **THEN** it uses the canonical `build/artifacts/python` topology
- **AND** root `dist/*` is not advertised as a supported artifact home.
