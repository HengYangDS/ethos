## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Skill Package Manifest

ETHOS SHALL bind provider-visible skill packages to content-addressed package
manifests that declare entrypoint, included files, required sections, digest
algorithm, quality rules, and capability classes.

#### Scenario: package digest mismatch is detected

- **GIVEN** a skill package manifest declares included files and an expected
  digest
- **WHEN** the package contents no longer match that digest
- **THEN** `ethos prove --gate playbooks-v2 --json` reports a required
  package digest gap

#### Scenario: unsafe package paths are rejected

- **GIVEN** a package manifest path, entrypoint, or included file uses an
  absolute path or a path escaping its allowed root
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates the manifest
- **THEN** validation reports a required package path gap without reading
  outside the repository or package directory

#### Scenario: package capabilities are classified

- **GIVEN** a package manifest declares command, MCP, script, or host
  capabilities
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates the manifest
- **THEN** readonly capabilities reject mutating commands, proof capabilities
  identify proof commands, and guarded mutation capabilities declare a guard
