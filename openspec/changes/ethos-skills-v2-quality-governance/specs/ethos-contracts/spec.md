## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Provider-neutral Skill Activation Contract

ETHOS SHALL represent skill activation through a provider-neutral contract IR
that preserves historical activation fixture rows while exposing V2 ownership,
operation, lifecycle, routing, composition, package, projection, and proof
metadata.

#### Scenario: historical activation normalizes without data loss

- **GIVEN** a v1 `.agents/skills/activation.toml` record with `id` or `name`
- **WHEN** ETHOS loads skill activation contracts
- **THEN** the normalized IR preserves the declared identifier source,
  subjects, path, path globs, intent tokens, pre-reads, post-checks,
  co-activation hints, commands, boundary fields, and fixture-specific
  extension fields
- **AND** the output remains readable for existing playbook JSON records

#### Scenario: strict activation requires V2 ownership

- **GIVEN** a playbook check runs in `v2-strict` mode
- **WHEN** an active primary skill lacks subject, operation, lifecycle, path
  coverage, package manifest, command affordances, or proof obligations
- **THEN** ETHOS reports deterministic required gaps

### Requirement: Skill Package Manifest

ETHOS SHALL bind provider-visible skill packages to content-addressed package
manifests that declare entrypoint, included files, required sections, digest
algorithm, quality rules, and capability classes.

#### Scenario: package digest mismatch is detected

- **GIVEN** a skill package manifest declares included files and an expected
  digest
- **WHEN** the package contents no longer match that digest
- **THEN** `ethos playbooks check --mode v2-strict --json` reports a required
  package digest gap

#### Scenario: unsafe package paths are rejected

- **GIVEN** a package manifest path, entrypoint, or included file uses an
  absolute path or a path escaping its allowed root
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates the manifest
- **THEN** validation reports a required package path gap without reading
  outside the repository or package directory

#### Scenario: package capabilities are classified

- **GIVEN** a package manifest declares command, MCP, script, or host
  capabilities
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates the manifest
- **THEN** readonly capabilities reject mutating commands, proof capabilities
  identify proof commands, and guarded mutation capabilities declare a guard
