## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Host installation and repository selection are distinct

ETHOS SHALL be installable outside its source checkout. Host installation SHALL
own reusable immutable version supply; repository bindings SHALL select exact
identities and retain repository-local policy and Git state. Adoption SHALL NOT
copy the product source or require ETHOS developer tools.

#### Scenario: Two repositories select installed supply

- **WHEN** two repositories select the same installed identity
- **THEN** they reuse immutable product bytes without sharing mutable repository state
- **AND** a repository selecting a different version remains unchanged

### Requirement: Installed product migration preserves live consumers

Installation, upgrade, rollback and uninstall SHALL use exact owned resources and
fresh live-consumer observations. Existing common-directory runtime generations
SHALL remain recoverable until their consumers have migrated. Unknown liveness
SHALL prevent deletion without erasing successful activation evidence.

#### Scenario: Upgrade is interrupted

- **WHEN** preparation or activation fails between durable effect and acknowledgement
- **THEN** recovery identifies the selected version and preserves the previous usable version
- **AND** it does not repeat a destructive effect from missing acknowledgement alone

#### Scenario: A live repository still references an old installation

- **WHEN** uninstall or reclamation finds a live version consumer
- **THEN** the consumer's selected bytes remain available
- **AND** cleanup reports the exact remaining dependency

### Requirement: Independent product acceptance exercises delivered artifacts

Acceptance SHALL execute installed CLI and real MCP client paths outside ETHOS
source, including valid, denied and unknown outcomes, repository isolation,
upgrade, rollback and exit. A wheel build, import or source-only test SHALL NOT
be reported as complete installed-product acceptance.

#### Scenario: A candidate builds without an MCP round trip

- **WHEN** package construction succeeds but no installed client journey has passed
- **THEN** artifact construction is recorded separately
- **AND** installed-product acceptance remains incomplete
