## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Semantic Python runtime bootstrap

ETHOS SHALL provide one repository-owned runtime bootstrap for product Python
execution. The bootstrap MUST bind `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` to
`build/runtime/venv` under the current Git worktree and MUST execute against
that checkout's source tree. The bootstrap SHALL expose an explicit cache
boundary: an explicitly supplied CI or operator cache location takes precedence;
otherwise uv download state uses a host-scoped content-addressed cache outside
the repository checkout.

#### Scenario: two Work Lanes initialize independently

- **GIVEN** two linked Work Lanes from the same Git common directory
- **WHEN** each runs a Python owner command through the bootstrap
- **THEN** each command receives its own `<worktree>/build/runtime/venv`
- **AND** neither command resolves `<worktree>/.venv` as its project environment
- **AND** the cache location does not become a Work Lane lease, source, evidence,
  or authority store

#### Scenario: a hook starts before its checkout environment exists

- **GIVEN** a hook requests the default
  `<worktree>/build/runtime/venv/bin/python` and that interpreter is absent
- **WHEN** the request passes through the runtime bootstrap
- **THEN** the bootstrap invokes `uv run --group dev python` with the original
  Python arguments and lets uv materialize only that checkout's environment
- **AND** it does not resolve `<worktree>/.venv/bin/python`

### Requirement: Explicit execution overrides remain bounded

ETHOS SHALL permit an explicit `ETHOS_PYTHON`, `PYTHON`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, or
`ETHOS_UV_CACHE_DIR` override for a bounded invocation. An override MUST NOT
change the checkout root, substitute another checkout's source environment, or
silently make root `.venv` the default runtime.

#### Scenario: CI supplies its own cache path

- **GIVEN** a hosted CI projection supplies an explicit uv cache location
- **WHEN** an owner script invokes the runtime bootstrap
- **THEN** the bootstrap preserves that cache location
- **AND** the source environment remains under the current checkout's
  `build/runtime/venv`
