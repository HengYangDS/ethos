# ETHOS Contracts

## Purpose

ETHOS SHALL define provider-neutral schemas, result envelopes, adapter
interfaces, policy records, evidence contracts, and command registry contracts
before provider implementations.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Provider-neutral Contracts
ETHOS SHALL keep JSON schemas, TOML config contracts, public result contracts,
attestation envelopes, evidence contracts, and package ontology records free of
provider-specific execution behavior.

#### Scenario: Contracts are inspected
- **WHEN** architecture tests scan `ethos-contracts`
- **THEN** contract modules do not import Git, SQLite, subprocess, hosted CI,
  assistant runtime, or adopter-private implementation modules

### Requirement: Package Ontology Contract
ETHOS SHALL expose the target product package ontology as a machine-readable
contract.

#### Scenario: Package ontology is reported
- **WHEN** `ethos quality package-ontology --json` runs
- **THEN** ETHOS reports target product packages, distribution adapters,
  migration host state, and physical target home readiness from one canonical
  contract

### Requirement: Migration Host Retirement Contract
ETHOS SHALL report active product migration hosts as an empty set when product
topology migration is closed.

#### Scenario: Package ontology is audited after migration closure
- **WHEN** `ethos quality package-ontology --json` runs
- **THEN** `migration_hosts` is empty
- **AND** `migration_status` is `complete`
- **AND** distribution adapters are reported separately from Python packages

### Requirement: Trust Envelope Contract
ETHOS SHALL define a provider-neutral trust envelope contract for claim
admission and proof consumers.

#### Scenario: Trust envelope is emitted
- **WHEN** ETHOS reports active claim governance
- **THEN** every trust envelope includes claim id, claim state, boundary,
  evidence, carriers, fallback, kill signal, promotion, and required gaps

### Requirement: Promotion Target Contract
ETHOS SHALL define promotion targets as provider-neutral repository authority
references.

#### Scenario: Promotion target is validated
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates a promotion target
- **THEN** the target kind is one of source, tests, docs, schema, openspec, or
  evidence
- **AND** the target path is repository-relative

### Requirement: Capability Profile Contract
ETHOS SHALL define capability profiles that map OpenSpec capabilities to owner,
boundary, routing, and proof metadata.

#### Scenario: Capability profile is inspected
- **WHEN** ETHOS validates capability profile metadata
- **THEN** the profile names a family, owner object, primary invariant,
  routing question, boundary rules, and proof profile

### Requirement: Single-Kernel Dual-Posture Contract
ETHOS SHALL define a shared governance context contract for the single-kernel dual-posture
model across product self-governance and adopter repository governance.

#### Scenario: Governance context is provider-neutral
- **WHEN** ETHOS emits `governance_context`
- **THEN** the context identifies `product_self` or `adopter_repository`
- **AND** the context records the governed repository subject, profile, kernel
  chain, and transition and scorecard command semantics
- **AND** `shared_commands` and `transition_commands` contain the five transition
  commands
- **AND** `scorecard_commands` contains `ethos report`
- **AND** provider, host, editor, model, and toolchain choices remain outside
  product semantics
